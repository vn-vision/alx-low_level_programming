0x14-bit_manipulation - C programming.

	:AND (&): Bitwise AND operation is used to set bits to 1 only if both corresponding bits in the operands are 1.
	:OR (|): Bitwise OR operation is used to set bits to 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits in the operands is 1.
	:XOR (^): Bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operation is used to set the bits that are different in the operands.
	:NOT (~): Bitwise NOT operation is used to flip each bit, changing 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s.
	:Left Shift (<<): Shifts the bits to the left by a specified number of positions, filling the vacant positions with 0.
	:Right Shift (>>): Shifts the bits to the right by a specified number of positions, filling the vacant positions with the sign bit (for signed integers) or 0 (for unsigned integers).

C is fun
